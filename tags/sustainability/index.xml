&lt;p&gt;In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users of open source software expect it to be open and free, but not necessarily supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizations that understand and prioritize open source often make reasonable requests for support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing limited resources with important user requests can be challenging in open source projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-profits like the Wikimedia Foundation are often aligned with open-source goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many organizations use open-source software but don&amp;rsquo;t support it financially&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source sustainability is dependent on sponsoring and promoting the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of support is a systemic problem in the open source community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separating business and open source entities can lead to success in open source projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective open source strategies involve balancing commercial goals and community values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indirect metrics like website traffic and brand recognition are used to measure adoption in open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
