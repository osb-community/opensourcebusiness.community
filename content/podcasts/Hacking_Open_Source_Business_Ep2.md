description: "Welcome to episode 2 of the Hacking Open Source Business podcast!  In this episode, Avi and Matt are joined by the CEO of Heroic Labs, Chris Molozian, and the Head of Developer Relations at Heroic Labs Gabriel Pene.  Heroic labs did not start off as an #opensource company but moved to #opensource later in the company's lifecycle.  Learn about some of the reasons why they made the switch, how they are currently using open source, and how open source has become critical to their product strategy."
