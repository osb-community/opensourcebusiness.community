description: Avi and Matt explore the trend of companies dropping open source licenses for non-osi approved licenses.  We cover the recent decision to move Akka to the BSL,  dropping the popular Apache 2 license.   Do we need a new set of open source licenses?  or do we need to stop hijacking the term open source for this new type of software?  Welcome to episode 1 of the Hacking Open Source Business Podcast!
