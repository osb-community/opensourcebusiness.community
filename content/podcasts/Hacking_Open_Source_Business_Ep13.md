description: "CEO and co-founder of MatterMost stops by the podcast to drop his wisdom and experience around building an open source company, goto market strategies, star trek, the importance of embracing the community, and more!  Ian also gives us the answer to a question we did not even know we wanted to be answered:  What happens when your open source software accidentally ends up in a highly secure nuclear facility?"
