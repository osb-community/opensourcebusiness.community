description: "This week we are joined by none other than the one and only Peter Zaitsev.  Peter is the Co-Founder of Percona, a successful open source database company that remained self-funded since its inception in 2006.  Peter drops his wisdom on building an open source startup, making it work with limited funds, and where the future of open source is taking us. Peter goes unscripted and give us his take on open source, companies in the open source space, and the difference between true open source companies and those using it as a business model."
