      "Description": "Isn’t open source largely tracked via contributor usage? Should GitHub-esque metrics remain the de facto standard for project health, adoption, and growth? The answer to both questions is no. Contributor metrics are great, but they don’t predict the commercial success of a product. Having more contributors than other similar projects may look good on paper, but that doesn’t denote users. Similarly, an increase in the number of contributors, pull requests, or issues on GitHub does not mean your project's user base is growing. It could even indicate the opposite. Growing the contributor base is certainly a directionally helpful indicator of a project's health and adoption, but it does not always directly correlate, nor is it a comprehensive measure considering all the other factors to take into account. So, what metrics should you look at to understand the overall growth of your project? ",

      "Description": "Tracking contributors still matters, but the way in which you do it makes a difference. Several projects have a handful of large corporate entities that contribute heavily to the code base of a project. You'll see spikes in contributors over time when in reality, those indicate when a new company joined the ecosystem. Tracking the companies, as well as the individuals who contribute, can help mitigate this. If a company or individual cares enough about the project to contribute to it, you are seeing growth. You can track such metrics in GitHub/GitLab, Bitergia, or in a tool like Orbit or Common Room that aggregates multiple sources. \n \n \n The caveat is that measuring the overall growth of all advocates, not just the code contributors, is difficult. Besides examining the number of people contributing to the code, you also want to look at the number of people releasing videos, blogs, talks, and other content into your ecosystem. These soft contributions can show project growth and success even better than hardcore code metrics, but tracking them is often manual.",
      "Goal": "If we are looking at this purely from a business perspective we are looking for growing number of contributors to the community and ecosystem. Long term sustainability should extend these, but will remain out of scope for this guide.",

In principle, more stars on GitHub would seem to equate to more interest or growth, but there is cause to think twice. A cursory search shows that dozens of services will give hundreds or thousands of stars to your project for only a few dollars. Some projects hold a suspiciously large number of stars for the code available. \n \n \n  Rather, project traffic and activity as reflected by the number of issues, merges, commits, etc., on GitHub, prove more telling. Moreover, it is more important to evaluate the number of unique users performing those activities over the raw number of activities. Unique traffic to your repositories, the unique number of forks, and the unique number of clones of your repo are all worth tracking in order to gauge growth. ",

      "Description": "We’ve covered some key metrics for measuring interest that come from external sources. Let’s take a closer look at some of the internal sources of data within your company that you can review. To access these numbers, you can employ a service such as Google Analytics, Chartbeat, Semrush, Amplitude Analytics, or Pendo, and work with your web development team to gain access. \n \n \n *Unique views:* \n \n \n Because bots and crawlers on the web can cause peaks in website traffic, identifying the number of unique views or companies interacting with your site is more valuable than the number of raw page views. You should be able to track the trend of your traffic over time and explain the dips and spikes. Growth of uniques over time shows increasing interest in your product. \n \n \n *Engagement with documentation, tutorials, and guides* \n \n \n Another indicator of interest in your product lies in a subset of your website traffic: engagement with docs, tutorials, and guides. Increased traffic of unique visitors in these sections typically signals more people who are seriously interested in trying out your product. It is also important to note that there are different weights to people’s actions that you should take into account, for instance, someone who revisits your website over and over again or someone who reviews your pricing page indicates more interest than merely a one-time visit to the homepage. Note that in addition to your website, your traffic also includes your open source docs, whether they are rendered on GitHub, an artifact registry like PyPI, Docker Hub, etc, or any mirrors. Approaches like tracking pixel-based analytics are able to capture web traffic data when OSS documentation is rendered anywhere online, rather than only domains that you own.",

      "Description": "*Users still active 90 days after their first install:* The best predictor for potential production usage or a possible future customer is ongoing usage. You want users to still actively use the software 90 days after downloading and installing it, and to do so after 180 days is even better. If the number of users who drop off before 90 days is high, then either the value of the software may be too low or the barrier of entry may be too high. To track active instances or uses of the software, you can use some lightweight telemetry  or in the absence of that, repeated downloads. \n \n \n *Companies and organizations using the software for more than six months:* Whereas the above metric focuses on users, this metric focuses on the total number of users at a single company or organization. Multiple users at the same company might be downloading and using the software. If you know that multiple users from the same company use your product repeatedly, that is a powerful indicator of potential growth.",

      "Description": "Not every department or team will value all of the above metrics the same, but these metrics as a whole do track the various stages of the user and customer lifecycle. Based on these metrics, you can gauge the overall interest in an open source project and determine if your decisions result in further adoption. Marketing and sales can ensure a growing funnel and close more deals. VC firms can evaluate business performance and receive assurance that their investments produce promising ROI. What is more, you can use the insights to improve your product and better satisfy the needs of your target audience. \n \n \n Even though open source has existed for a while, the playbook for open source done right is still in the making and ever evolving. Despite three major models repeatedly emerging in the space, there truly is no traditional path for the open source business. Yet the need to account for growth, as with any company, still applies. \n \n \n Measuring the interest, adoption, and growth of open source projects extends beyond just contributors. It is important to triangulate key metrics within each stage of the open source funnel to draw meaningful analysis and conclusions that can help you understand how users are progressing through the customer journey. One of the many beauties of open source is that it provides a broad user base by opening up the technology to anyone and everyone who takes interest thanks to virtually no financial barrier to entry, or any barrier at all! To that end, if you can appeal to loyal existing users and find a way to both monetize and augment their usage, the possibilities could be exceedingly beneficial and worth billions of dollars. Open source creators plus data-driven insights make for a powerful combination.",
